# smallsh
Shell written in C

# Description
Assignment from Oregon State University CS344 Operating Systems I to write a shell writen in C. The shell will run commandline instructions and return results similar to other shells, but without many of the fancier features. This shell will allow for redirection of standard input and standard output and it will support foreground and background processes (controllable by the command line and be receiving signals). The shell suports three built in commands: exit, cd, and status. It also supports comments which are lines beginning with #. 

# Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. cd smallsh
3. `make`
4. `./smallsh`
5. Run commands like this were a shell
6. `make clean`
